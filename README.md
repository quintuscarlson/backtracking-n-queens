# Backtracking Constraint Solver (N-Queens)
A Python implementation of the classic N-Queens problem using recursive backtracking. The algorithm places one queen per column on an 8×8 chessboard while ensuring no two queens attack each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features 
- Recursive backtracking algorithm
- Checks rows, columns, and all diagonals for conflicts
- Prunes invalid board states early
- Console-based board visualization
